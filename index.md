title: Introduction

This site contains adaptation of problems from the site "[99 Problems in Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)".
In the spirit of the original problems solutions that we list and accept for inclusion in here are written in the functional style. We look at the plain vanilla Java 8 solutions as well as those that use libraries used for expressive functional style.
